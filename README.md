# Vanilla Press by @kunikla, Version 0.2

###Assignment for [JavaScript for WordPress](https://javascriptforwp.com/), by Zac Gordon

* Lesson 1.6.08 â€“ Pages
* Lesson 1.6.09 - Updating the Model
* Lesson 1.6.10 - Building the View Menu
* Lesson 1.6.11 - The Single Content View

Modify V0.1 as follows:
* New data file with posts and pages
* Create a dynamic menu of pages
* Display Home page when url is empty
* Display other pages when menu clicked
* Display blog posts on Blog page


I listened to the lectures to understand the desired behavior, but the JS coding is my own.
